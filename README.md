# HUMAN
A HUMAN LANGUAGE FOR HUMANS

HUMAN IS A STACK-BASED HUMAN LANGUAGE FOR HUMANS. ~~COMPUTATION~~ CONVERSATION IS DONE BY PUSHING THINGS TO THE STACK, THEN 
DOING THINGS TO THE STACK AS A WHOLE

### PROJECT STATUS
PARSER IS TERRIBLY DESIGNED BUT DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO ( ALMOST )

CURRENTLY, PARSER CAN PARSE SOME THINGS BUT FOR SOME REASON THROWS ERRORS AT NEARLY EVERY LINE

### GRAMMAR

**STATEMENTS:**
THERE ARE NONE, EVERYTHING HAS FUNCTION-LIKE SYNTAX

**BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**
- `STACK.PUSH ( PARAMETER )` PUSHES `PARAMETER` TO THE TOP OF THE STACK
- `STACK.LIST` RETURNS ALL ITEMS IN THE STACK IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER SEPERATED WITH `\s`
- `SAY ( PARAMETER )` SAYS `PARAMETER`
MORE WILL BE ADDED AS SOON AS I GET THE PARSER WORKING CORRECTLY.
